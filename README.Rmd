# SampleBuilder
Paul Hegedus

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SampleBuilder is to help in generating sampling designs. SampleBuilder has functions for building transects, gridded systematic points, and random points. 

## Installation

You can install the most up to date version of SampleBuilder from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paulhegedus/SampleBuilder")
```

## Make Transects Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to build transects for a line layer:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(SampleBuilder)

## Make Transects
t_lines <- make_transects(
  line_layer_path = "/Path/To/The/Line/Layer/Filename.shp",
  t_number = 10, # 10 transects
  t_length = 1000, # l000m transect length
  t_size = 10, # 10m x 10m transect cells
  buddy_t = TRUE, # each transect has a buddy
  direction = "positive", # transects only built to the N or W of line layer
  allow_overlaps = FALSE # overlaps of transects are allowed
)

## Make Points along Transects
t_pts <- make_transect_pts(t_lines, 1000, 10)

## Create Sampling Info - data.frame with 'name', 'type', and 'default' cols
sampling_info <- data.frame(
  name = c("date", "comment1", "comment2", "comment3"),
  type = c("character", "character", "character", "character"),
  default = rep(NA, 4)
)

## Add Sampling Information to File
t_lines_wInfo <- add_info(t_lines, sampling_info)
t_pts_wInfo <- add_info(t_pts, sampling_info)

## Save Transect Lines and Points
sf::st_write(t_lines_wInfo, "/Path/To/Save/Location/And/Filename.shp")
sf::st_write(t_pts_wInfo, "/Path/To/Save/Location/And/Filename.shp")

```

```{r, out.width='100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='**Figure 1.** Example of 10 1km transects only in the positive direction. Each of the 5 transects visible have a buddy transect that is between 1 and 3 transect widths from the other for efficient sampling.', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('man/figures/transects_positive_wBuddy_n10.png')
```


## Make Grid Example

This is a basic example of how to build a gridded sampling design for an area:

```{r}
# library(SampleBuilder)
## basic example code
```

## Make Random Points Example

This is a basic example of how to build random points across an area:

```{r}
# library(SampleBuilder)
## basic example code
```
